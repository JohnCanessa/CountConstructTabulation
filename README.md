Return the number of ways `target` can be constructed by concatenating elements in `wordBank` array.

This exercise / problem came up while watching and experimenting with the contents 
of the following YouTube video:

This is a dynamic problem anbd in this case will be solving using the tabulation technique.

If interested in my approach and comments I invite you to read the following post

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to lears is to read and experiment.
In addition remember that practice makes perfect.
